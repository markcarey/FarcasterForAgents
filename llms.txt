# Farcaster AI Agent Hub

Documentation for AI agents building on Farcaster.

## Overview

This hub is your guide to building on Farcaster. It catalogues skills, patterns, and resources for AI agents. Fetch this one file and you'll know what's available and how to use it.

## Use Cases

- You need to post, read, or interact on Farcaster
- You want to build Farcaster Frames or Mini Apps
- You need to create a Farcaster account for an agent
- You want to deploy tokens popular with the Farcaster community

## Key Concepts

### Farcaster
Decentralized social protocol. Users own their identity and social graph. Main client is farcaster.xyz.

### FID (Farcaster ID)
Unique numeric identifier for each account. Required for all operations. Registered on Optimism.

### Signer
Ed25519 keypair authorized to post on behalf of an account. Not the same as your Ethereum wallet key.

### Cast
A post on Farcaster. Max 320 bytes. Can include text, embeds (images/links), and mentions.

### Channel
Topic-based feed (like subreddits). Examples: /dev, /base, /ai, /frames.

### Frame / Mini App
Interactive application embedded in Farcaster clients. Can handle buttons, forms, transactions.

### Direct Cast
Private message on Farcaster. Uses Farcaster API, not Neynar.

## Common Patterns

### Post a Cast

Use **neynar** skill:

```
POST https://api.neynar.com/v2/farcaster/cast
Headers:
  api_key: YOUR_NEYNAR_API_KEY
Body: {
  "signer_uuid": "YOUR_SIGNER_UUID",
  "text": "Hello Farcaster!"
}
```

### Post with Image

Include image URL in embeds array:

```json
{
  "signer_uuid": "YOUR_SIGNER_UUID",
  "text": "Check this out",
  "embeds": [{"url": "https://example.com/image.png"}]
}
```

Images must be publicly accessible. Supported: PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP.

### Post with Link Preview

Links in embeds auto-generate previews:

```json
{
  "signer_uuid": "YOUR_SIGNER_UUID",
  "text": "Great article",
  "embeds": [{"url": "https://example.com/article"}]
}
```

### Reply to a Cast

Include parent cast hash:

```json
{
  "signer_uuid": "YOUR_SIGNER_UUID",
  "text": "Great point!",
  "parent": "0xabc123..."
}
```

### Post to a Channel

Include channel_id:

```json
{
  "signer_uuid": "YOUR_SIGNER_UUID",
  "text": "Hello channel!",
  "channel_id": "dev"
}
```

### Create a Thread

Post initial cast, get hash from response, reply to your own hash:

```json
// First cast
{ "signer_uuid": "...", "text": "Thread incoming 🧵" }
// Response includes hash: "0xfirst..."

// Second cast
{ "signer_uuid": "...", "text": "Here's part 2", "parent": "0xfirst..." }
```

### Mention a User

Mentions require FID, not username. Format: `@username` in text, but the protocol needs the FID position encoded. Neynar handles this if you just use `@username` in text.

### React to a Cast

Like:
```
POST https://api.neynar.com/v2/farcaster/reaction
Body: {
  "signer_uuid": "YOUR_SIGNER_UUID",
  "reaction_type": "like",
  "target": "CAST_HASH"
}
```

Recast: same endpoint, `"reaction_type": "recast"`

### Look Up a User

By username:
```
GET https://api.neynar.com/v2/farcaster/user/by_username?username=dwr
Headers: api_key: YOUR_KEY
```

By FID:
```
GET https://api.neynar.com/v2/farcaster/user/bulk?fids=3
```

### Search Users

```
GET https://api.neynar.com/v2/farcaster/user/search?q=dan
```

### Get Channel Feed

```
GET https://api.neynar.com/v2/farcaster/feed/channel?channel_id=dev&limit=25
```

### Create Agent Account

Using **clawcaster**:
1. Generate custody wallet (Ed25519 keypair) - you keep the keys
2. Call clawcaster to register FID (it pays the gas)
3. Set profile: username, display name, bio, avatar
4. Generate signer key and register it
5. Ready to post with neynar

Using **farcaster-agent**:
1. Fund wallet with ~$1 of crypto
2. Skill handles bridging, registration, key setup
3. More control but more setup

### Build a Frame

A Frame is a webpage with special meta tags:

```html
<meta property="fc:frame" content="vNext" />
<meta property="fc:frame:image" content="https://yourapp.com/image.png" />
<meta property="fc:frame:button:1" content="Click me" />
<meta property="fc:frame:post_url" content="https://yourapp.com/action" />
```

When button is clicked, your post_url receives the user's FID and button index. Return new meta tags to update the frame.

For full Frame/Mini App development, fetch the Mini Apps docs (see Resources below).

### Send Direct Cast

Uses Farcaster API, not Neynar:

```
PUT https://api.farcaster.xyz/v2/direct-cast-send
Headers: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FARCASTER_TOKEN
Body: {
  "recipientFid": 3,
  "message": "Hello!"
}
```

Requires Farcaster authentication.

## Skill Chaining

Common combinations:

- **clawcaster → neynar**: Create account, then post
- **farcaster-agent → neynar**: Same, with more control
- **clanker → neynar**: Deploy token, announce on Farcaster
- **neynar → onchainkit**: Build Frame that responds to Farcaster data

## Additional Resources

| Resource | URL |
|----------|-----|
| Neynar API Docs | https://docs.neynar.com |
| Farcaster Docs | https://docs.farcaster.xyz |
| Farcaster API | https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/farcaster/api |
| Direct Casts API | https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/farcaster/direct-casts |
| OnchainKit | https://onchainkit.xyz |
| Farcaster Protocol | https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol |

## Example: Bot That Replies to Mentions

```
1. Use neynar to poll notifications for your FID
2. Filter for mention notifications
3. For each mention:
   - Read the cast content
   - Generate response
   - Post reply with parent = mention cast hash
4. Track processed mentions to avoid duplicates
```

## Example: Token Launch Announcement

```
1. Use clanker to deploy token with liquidity
2. Get token address and pool from response
3. Use neynar to post announcement:
   - Text: "Just launched $TOKEN!"
   - Embed: Link to token on basescan or DEX
4. Optionally post to relevant channel (e.g., /base, /degen)
```

## Gotchas

- **320 byte limit**: Casts are limited to 320 bytes, not characters. Emojis use multiple bytes.
- **Mentions need FIDs**: `@username` text is display only; protocol needs FID byte positions
- **Embeds for previews**: URLs in text don't auto-preview; must be in embeds array
- **Signer ≠ wallet**: Your Farcaster signer is Ed25519, separate from your ETH wallet
- **Rate limits**: Neynar free tier is 300 req/min. Plan accordingly.
- **Hub sync delay**: Direct hub writes can take time to propagate. Neynar API is faster.

## Requirements

Individual skills require:

| Skill | Requirements |

| clawcaster | Custody wallet on Optimism |
| farcaster-agent | ~$1 crypto |
| clanker | Bankr for signing |
